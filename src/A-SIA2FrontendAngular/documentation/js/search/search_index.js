   \n            \n                Provides a command history, to use just inject in constructor.\nWith the function append, you can add a command in the history. Make sure to execute it beforehand.\nThe functions undo and redo can be used to navigate in the command history.\nIf append is called while you are a number of steps into the history,\nall commands that would be executed by redoing, will be removed from the history.\nThe maxHistorySize can be set, and will limit the capacity of the History, removing the oldest entry if exceeded.\n\n

using rxjs, it is basically a primitive implementation of the redux pattern / ngrx.\nThis store especially, implements endpoints for optimistic UI updates, which changes the UI (aka. cached values), sends\nthe server request afterwards, and reverts the UI in case of an error.\nThe store uses BehaviorSubjects to cache, and publish values (in this case asiaInstances).\nBehaviorSubjects are especially advantageous as they always have a value, and therefore don't necessarily need to be subscribed to.\nInstead, a value can be retrieved by calling .getValue (or _getSourceValues in the store). The BehaviorSubject is exposed to the outside as\nan Observable (get values$()), so that no-one can do responsibility breaking stuff with the subject itself (like calling .next() in a component).\nThe $ symbol at the end of variable / getter names is a naming convention commonly used for observables.\nEvery store has a initialization (_load()), a way to get cached values from the inside (_getSourceValues) / outside (values$) and\na way to set values from the inside (_setSourceValues()).\nBe careful to keep values immutable, that is, don't change an existing cached value. Rather, copy all values, add / remove some, and then _setSourceValues();.\nThis can be easily done with the spread operator. This ensures that references change when notifying subscribers, and therefore enables ChangeDetection.OnPush\nfor future performance gains.\nIn some cases, especially when wanting to enable undo / redo, it might be advantageous to extract actions like add, update, and\ndelete, into their own classes Action. While not only keeping the Store classes themselves slim, as they only have to\ncall .act(), and maybe .revert(), this also makes caching possibly to be reverted values easier.\nActions usually also have a loading$ observable that indicate wether they are done / successful.\n\n            \n\n\n\n            \n    Index\n    \n        \n                \n                    \n

especially, implements endpoints for optimistic UI updates, which changes the UI (aka. cached values), sends\n * the server request afterwards, and reverts the UI in case of an error.\n *\n * The store uses BehaviorSubjects to cache, and publish values (in this case asiaInstances).\n * BehaviorSubjects are especially advantageous as they always have a value, and therefore don't necessarily need to be subscribed to.\n * Instead, a value can be retrieved by calling .getValue (or _getSourceValues in the store). The BehaviorSubject is exposed to the outside as\n * an Observable (get values$()), so that no-one can do responsibility breaking stuff with the subject itself (like calling .next() in a component).\n *\n * The $ symbol at the end of variable / getter names is a naming convention commonly used for observables.\n *\n * Every store has a initialization (_load()), a way to get cached values from the inside (_getSourceValues) / outside (values$) and\n * a way to set values from the inside (_setSourceValues()).\n *\n * Be careful to keep values immutable, that is, don't change an existing cached value. Rather, copy all values, add / remove some, and then _setSourceValues();.\n * This can be easily done with the spread operator. This ensures that references change when notifying subscribers, and therefore enables ChangeDetection.OnPush\n * for future performance gains.\n *\n * In some cases, especially when wanting to enable undo / redo, it might be advantageous to extract actions like add, update, and\n * delete, into their own classes {@link Action}. While not only keeping the Store classes themselves slim, as they only have to\n * call .act(), and maybe .revert(), this also makes caching possibly to be reverted values easier.\n * Actions usually also have a loading$ observable that indicate wether they are done / successful.\n *\n */\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class InstanceStoreService {\n  readonly _source = new

Description\n    \n    \n        This element is only used internally, and generated automatically. If a bordering (at the start or end of container)\npane has both minSize and maxSize (so can't be resized) there will be no divider next to it.\nThe PaneDividerComponent's host element actually has no size. It is a 0 width / height element,\nthat has an absolutely positioned element centered over it. It having no width makes the whole Pane sizing process a whole lot easier.\nYou might notice that the cursor changes when hovering / resizing. This had to be done globally, by adding and removing\na css class to the body (ns-resize or ew-resize, you can see them (in code) in the global styling file styles.scss).\nSee also:

of the *ngIf directive, except that it calls a function before and after.\nSee also: Angular Custom Structural Directives\nIn this case it hides all children before hiding / showing a new element. If this isn't done, the [order] binding\nin the PaneContainerComponent template will cause some flashing artifacts, as the order is not correct for one frame.\nThe solution was hiding everything through the parent (injected in constructor),\nwaiting a tick, and then showing everything again. (The tick is done through a setTimeout in the parent showChildrenAfterNgIf)\nThis also means that it can only be used if the parent is a PaneContainerComponent.\nThis still leads to some flickering, but is easier than a diploma in angular's change detection.\nCONTENT\n            \n\n\n\n        \n            Metadata\n            \n                \n\n                    \n

A pane can have restrictions, like minSize, maxSize and a default size.\nPer default, it will be sized automatically depending on the other panes sizes. Be careful, setting the total size of panes is larger or smaller than the container\n(through setting minSizes and maxSizes too large / small), will lead to undefined behavior.\nDividers are generated between each panes, except if the first or last pane has both minSize and maxSize (and is therefore not resizable).\nWhen moving a divider, the panes to the left and right of the divider are resized accordingly. If the size of a pane gets to it's minSize / maxSize while resizing,\nthe pane will get get \"pulled\" or \"pushed\", and the pane next to it will be resized instead. This effect may propagate until the end of the container, after which it stops resizing.\nPanes can get toggled with the *aSiaPaneIf structural directive. You could also use *ngIf, but this will lead to more flickering due to lifecycle and change detection.\nIt also works with touch. The direction can be bound to a variable. If the direction changes, it will automatically resize everything again, relative to [size] and restrictions.\nStructure\nThe PaneContainerComponent is the main overseeing component, handling all top level work,\nsuch as resizing, initialization, different units (%, px, rem), etc.\nThe PaneComponent is the only component that should be in the .\nThe Pane itself has a minSize, maxSize, and size attribute, and can be toggled with the PaneIfDirective.\nThe PaneDividerComponent is mainly visual, and doesn't contain much logic.\nFunctionality\nResizing was approached by utilizing css flex.
