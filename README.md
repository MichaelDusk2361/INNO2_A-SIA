# A-SIA 2.0

This project concerns itself with the topic of social impulse analysis. Social impulse analysis is 
all about recording, visualizing, and evaluating social connections within a group.
A software developed in 2010 already provides a basis for this project.

A-SIA 1.0 was a software for modeling teams and social networks. The tool supported 
the recording of the influencing structures, which could either be entered manually 
or be automatically generated from answered questionnaires. The relationship 
patterns collected in this way were graphically displayed and support the 
processing of social and group dynamic phenomena in teams. Furthermore, it 
simulated What-If scenarios, visualizing group dynamic effects.
